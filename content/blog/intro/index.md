After months of painstakingly planning the perfect double-layered, low maintenance yet decoupled, static website solution...
it would be nice to deploy a website.

So tonight I sat down in front of the TV and grabbed a feature-rich starter template for the [GatsbyJS static site generator](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
I'll be writing more later about why I chose this solution, but in short it's about being agile and leading with delivered value.

More information is available about the boilerplate in use on the [gatsby-material-starter GitHub repository page](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter).
